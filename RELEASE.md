# Release History

*****************

## Release ONDEWO CSI Js Client 5.5.0

### Improvements

* Built against [ondewo-csi-api 5.5.0](https://github.com/ondewo/ondewo-csi-api/releases/tag/5.5.0), which tracks ondewo-nlu-api 7.1.0 (was 7.0.0) and ondewo-s2t-api 7.5.0 (was 7.4.0).
* `ondewo/csi/conversation.proto` is unchanged in that API release, so the CSI service surface is identical and this client stays wire-compatible with its predecessor. What grows is the vendored surface it re-exports: `speech-to-text.proto` gains the `VadMethod` and `TsdMethod` enums and the `Silero` and `WespeakerTsd` messages (voice-activity and turn-shift detection configuration), and `rag.proto` gains `RagCrawlerIncrementalConfig`.

## Release ONDEWO CSI Js Client 5.4.1

### Bug Fixes

* [[OND221-2830]](https://ondewo.atlassian.net/browse/OND221-2830) Regenerated with [ondewo-proto-compiler 5.13.0](https://github.com/ondewo/ondewo-proto-compiler/releases/tag/5.13.0).
* [[OND221-2830]](https://ondewo.atlassian.net/browse/OND221-2830) No change to how the auth helper is consumed: this package ships a webpack bundle rather than a public-api barrel, and the auth helper is a Node-only `undici` consumer that does not belong in a browser bundle. It ships as its own CommonJS entry and is imported directly (`require('<pkg>/auth/offlineTokenProvider')`).
* [[OND221-2830]](https://ondewo.atlassian.net/browse/OND221-2830) Tooling: `conventional-pre-commit` now runs before `giticket` at the commit-msg stage - with giticket first, its `[OND221-2830] fix: ...` rewrite was no longer valid Conventional Commits and every commit on a ticket branch failed. `README.md` is prettier-ignored where `.prettierrc` sets `useTabs` and markdownlint's MD010 de-tabs the same blocks, and the codegen `docker run` invocations no longer pass `-it`, which fails outside a TTY.
